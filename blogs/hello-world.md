# Hello World

This is my first blog post using the new automated system. I just need to add a markdown file to the `blogs` folder and it appears here automatically.

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: Write in standard markdown.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks look great.
- **Automated**: No manual HTML editing.
- **Images**: Support for optimized images.

![Example Image](/images/blog/example.png)

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello from the blog!")
```

Stay tuned for more updates!
